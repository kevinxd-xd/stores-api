# Stores-API
## Purpose
> Instead of having to constantly check websites to see if a product has restocked or changed, why not have a computer do it for me!
## Requirements
> Latest version of Node.js  âœ…
## Install
> Open your terminal and navigate to the directory of where the repo is located on your machine
> 
> Run the command _**"npm install"**_ to install all of the necessary dependencies
> 
> Don't worry if you get a warning about the current node version you're on. As long as your Node version isn't too outdated, everything should run smoothly 
>

## Prerequisites for .env
> If you are deploying on Heroku you may skip this part
> 
> Otherwise, if you are hosting the API locally, you may want to create a .env file with **"PORT=\<desired port\>"** if you have a particular port or site you would like to host through
